# School_District_Analysis
Performing analysis on school district
## Overview of Project
    The project oversees the data that is needed to have a better understanding of student funding and students' standardized test scores. The main purpose of the analysis is to find out the trends in school performance by accessing and aggregating the data.


## Results of the analysis

- The school district analysis has started with collecting the into data frame, followed by preparing the data. After checking and removing the rows with the null value - 1968 that were registered for reading scores, we were able to tell what type of data we would be working with: interger, object, but also float data.

- On the first observation of the data, after using the describe function, we were able to register the average score in reading test - 72.35 and the average math score - 64.67. That would allow us to state, that the students got higher scores in reading tests, compared to the math tests. Furthermore, we were able to find the lowest budget allocated for both public and charter schools - 817615.00, and on  the flip side, the highest budget being 991918. The standard deviation for the reading score was 15.22, compared to the standard deviation in math scores: 15.84.
 - Drilling down into the data, we were able to display the average reading score the  for the students in the ninth grade: 69.23. The lowest math score for the same category would be: 53.0000  and the highest math score being 100.0000. We can mention the average budget allocated for the students in the ninth grade: 898692.606002. Also, the minimum overall reading score was 10.5 was registered at Dixon High School, and it belongs to Mathew Thomas, who is in the 10th grade. Another outcome is given by the average score for the students in the 11th and 12th grade, which is 62.35.

 - Another outcome of the analysis is the comparison of the budgets between the charter schools and the public schools. The budgets allocated for the charter schools - 872625.656236 were smaller than the budgets for the public schools - 911195.558251. Furthermore, the most students were enrolled in Montgomery High School - 2038 students, and only 171 students in Chang High School. The students in the 9th grade obtained the highest math scores.
 
 ## Summary
    Summarizing this report and the school district  database being  very complex,  we also could on one hand, determine the difference between the reading scores and the budget allocated to both public and charter schools. On the other hand, we could find out the budget that was allocated to each high school.
